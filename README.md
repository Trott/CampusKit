CampusKit makes it easy to create high-performance, touch-friendly websites and apps for mobile and tablet devices. 

See it in action at http://m.ucsf.edu/. (Actually, not yet. It's on our staging server. Will be in production soon. Honest.)

Getting Started
-

1. Clone the repo
2. Make the `/htdocs` directory your docroot in your web server
3. Open your site in a web browser.
4. Really, that's all.
5. ...
6. OK, there's theming, modules, build process, etc. More documentation coming soon. Honest!

Dependencies
-

None! Nada! Zip! The resulting app is a pile of HTML, JS, and CSS. Sure, you'll need PhoneGap to build apps, and Grunt for the build process if you go that route.
